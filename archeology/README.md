# Spiral Codex: AI Decipherment and Symbolic Inference of the Phaistos Disc

The **Phaistos Disc** is an ideal centerpiece for an AI exploration project: visually iconic, historically rich, and still shrouded in mystery. This project aims to reframe the academic and public conversation around the disc, blending serious decipherment attempts with speculative modeling and machine intelligence.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Scaffold

### Title (Working):

**Spiral Codex: AI Decipherment and Symbolic Inference of the Phaistos Disc**

### Core Objective:

Use computer vision and transformer-based language models to segment, classify, and interpret the 45 glyphs stamped into the Phaistos Disc. The goal is not direct translation but to:

* Identify structural patterns
* Analyze co-occurrence and repetition logic
* Infer symbolic or spatial intent (e.g., inventory, ritual steps, cosmological map)

## üìö Training Data

To power this system, you would need to:

* Use publicly available images of the Phaistos Disc (e.g., from the Heraklion Museum, academic archives)
* Reconstruct vector versions of the 45 distinct glyphs (Unicode representations are available)
* Build synthetic corpora of hypothetical glyph sequences for pretraining or fine-tuning models

## üß† Research Contribution

This project could result in:

* The first open-source glyph-to-embedding AI pipeline for the Phaistos Disc
* A visual + statistical exploration tool for researchers and the public
* A publishable paper, interactive demo, or narrative AI application exploring the disc's speculative meaning

## üîÑ Next Steps

Let us know if you'd like help with any of the following:

* Drafting the GitHub repo and full README
* Writing a research paper abstract or proposal
* Finding datasets and high-quality reconstructions of the disc to begin modeling
